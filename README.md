# Project Voter

Project Voter is a web application that allows users to create and participate in voting programs. Users can vote for participants and view real-time results displayed on a bar chart.

Original project voter was created using Laravel but I have made this in NextJS to demonstrate my skills and experience in another popular framework (and to demonstrate that I am a very keen learner).
